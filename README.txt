REQUIREMENTS
============

* django (1.2, known not to work on older versions)
* simplejson
* pysqlite, if using Python < 2.5
* gettext

The virtualenv install script installs everything but the Python sqlite
extension.

HOW TO RUN
==========

# Create virtualenv environment
./install-virtualenv.sh

# Create local configuration
cp sikteeri/local_settings.py.template sikteeri/local_settings.py

# Set at least a secret key, preferably a working email address too
$EDITOR sikteeri/local_settings.py

# init virtualenv and set PYTHONPATH=.. (added to activate script in install)
source env/bin/activate

# Compile translations
./run-sikteeri.sh

MIGRATION CONSIDERATIONS
==========

When importing data from legacy database, make sure that the reference
number format in Sikteeri is different from that used in the legacy
system. This way it is possible to distinguish easily which bills were
generated by Sikteeri in case any problems arise.

It is possible to either import all legacy data and mark all cycles paid
or the cycles can be imported with proper reference numbers and the
payment data can be also imported and that way the payment control be
synchronized as well. In this case it is necessary to duplicate any
manual modifications to billing data (such as payments with wrong
reference number etc).
